# TODO: Make Navbar Responsive for Mobile

- [x] Run the app locally using `npm run dev` to start the development server.
- [ ] Launch browser and navigate to the local server URL (e.g., http://localhost:56214).
- [ ] Use browser dev tools to simulate mobile view and test navbar responsiveness (hamburger menu toggle, menu collapse/expand, styling preservation).
- [ ] Identify any issues (e.g., overlap, poor spacing, transition smoothness) while keeping the existing design (black background, colors, animations).
- [x] If issues found, make targeted CSS adjustments in `app/styles/navbar.css` (e.g., improve padding, add transitions, adjust z-index).
- [x] Implement push-down behavior for mobile menu (menu expands page height instead of overlaying).
- [x] Ensure desktop behavior remains unchanged (menu inside navbar).
- [ ] Re-test the changes in mobile view.
- [ ] Confirm with user if further tweaks are needed.
